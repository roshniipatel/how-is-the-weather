# How Is The Weather?

## Description

I have created this app to show you the weather of the city you live in. It shows for the current day as well as the next five days. It uses mostly JavaScript along with HTML and CSS as well as the weather api.

## Usage 

The only thing you have to do is click on the 'Search City Here' which is where you will add your current city's name and then hit search which will quickly generate the weather for the day of and the next five days for you.
